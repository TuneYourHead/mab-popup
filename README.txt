This is my attempt to make a smart modal window using jquery and animate.css.
Download mab-popup.js and mab-popup.css and add it to your project.
To use it u'll need to:
  1. create the modal itself and give it an id.
  2. add to your modal the data-pop-animation with value of animate.css animation name
  3. add to your modal the data-pop-animation-out if needed
  4. you can add the dark overlay to the modal simply adding the 'darkOverlayOn' class to it
  5. you can also assign the button to show the pop up and to hide it with data-pop="yourModalId" and data-pop-out="yourModalId"
